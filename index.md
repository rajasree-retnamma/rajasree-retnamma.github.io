### My Journey

I hold a **B.Tech. (Hons.) in Chemical Engineering** from the University of Calicut, India, followed by an **M.Tech. and Ph.D.** from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. My doctoral research, titled *"Computer-Aided Synthesis, Design and Optimization of Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) Processes"*, laid the foundation for my career in advanced process modeling. After my Ph.D., I pursued a **Post-Doctoral Fellowship** at Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands, where I explored the kinetics of automotive exhaust gas catalysis through modeling.

My career has spanned continents and institutions, encompassing diverse roles such as Researcher at the National Laboratory for Energy and Geology (LNEG) in Lisbon, Portugal; Research Professor at Hankyong National University, South Korea; Senior Research Associate at the National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, India; and Assistant Professor at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India, among others, while I have also served as a Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Saintgits College of Engineering, Kottayam, India.

### My Expertise

My research focuses on **energy and environmental engineering**, with a keen interest in **hydrogen energy** and **Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS)**. I specialize in:
- Process modeling, simulation, and optimization of chemical processes
- Adsorption technology, particularly Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA)
- Chemical reaction engineering and kinetic modeling

Some of my notable works include:
- Synthesis of platinum group metal-free electrocatalysts for water electrolyzers
- Carbon footprint evaluation and reduction strategies
- Hydrogen gas purification and separation
- Hydrolysis kinetics of chemical hydrides for fuel cell applications
- Sorption-enhanced reaction processes for hydrogen production

### My Contributions

I’m an active member of the **Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers (IIChE)**, **American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE)**, and **American Chemical Society (ACS)**. I’ve published numerous papers in national and international journals, presented at conferences worldwide, served as a resource person for three international conferences, and chaired conference sessions.
